//here 1 is land and 0 is water in LC

//tc- O(4*n2) which is simply written as O(n2)
//This is because each cell of the matrix is processed at most 4 times. For Example, a particular cell can call a cell to its north, east, west or south.

//sc-O(n2)
//Since a 2D array is used to store "visited" elements hence the space complexity is quadratic.
